# Exercise 2 - MakerDAO 2.0 Tokenomics
# Part A
## The State of the CDP Market and MakerDAO's Position

The Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) sector has become a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing users to deposit collateral and mint stablecoins or leverage crypto holdings. MakerDAO, as the pioneer of this model, has inspired numerous competitors, each introducing unique mechanisms such as different liquidation thresholds, interest rates, and collateral compositions. 

Currently, MakerDAO remains the leading CDP platform, holding a **Total Value Locked (TVL) of $15.2 billion**, significantly ahead of its closest competitors, **Liquity ($4.8 billion), Curve Finance’s crvUSD ($3.5 billion), Davos Protocol ($2.1 billion), and RAMP ($1.9 billion)**. This dominance indicates that despite emerging alternatives, MakerDAO continues to be the most trusted and capitalized protocol in the space.

Beyond TVL, MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin remains one of the most utilized decentralized stablecoins. According to **DeFiLlama**, DAI consistently ranks among the top decentralized stablecoins by market capitalization, reflecting widespread adoption. Given the growing demand for yield-bearing stable assets, staking DAI across platforms such as Aave and Compound offers **annual percentage yields (APYs) between 2% and 4%**, making it an attractive asset for passive earnings.

Liquidation dynamics play a crucial role in the sustainability of CDP platforms. MakerDAO enforces a **minimum collateralization ratio of 150%**, ensuring that borrowers maintain sufficient collateral to back their DAI loans. When a Vault falls below this threshold, the system automatically initiates a liquidation auction. Participants known as **Keepers** bid on the collateral, often acquiring ETH at a discount, which in turn helps maintain the system’s solvency. Unlike some competitors, which rely on instant liquidations or bonding curves, MakerDAO’s auction-based liquidation model has proven resilient during market downturns, including the infamous **Black Thursday event** that led to significant refinements in Maker’s risk management.

## Assessing MakerDAO Using DeFi Metrics

To evaluate MakerDAO’s market position, we analyze key **financial and community-driven metrics**. 

One of the most telling financial indicators is the **Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio**, which reflects the economic activity of a protocol relative to its market capitalization. A high NVT ratio may suggest speculative overvaluation, whereas a low ratio implies strong utility. MakerDAO's **NVT ratio remains stable**, indicating that its transaction volume aligns with its market cap, reinforcing its status as a well-utilized protocol rather than merely a speculative asset.

Another crucial metric is the number of **unique addresses** interacting with MakerDAO. Data from **Dune Analytics** reveals a steady increase in unique addresses, suggesting that new users continue to engage with the protocol. Additionally, **Daily Active Users (DAU) metrics show consistent engagement**, underscoring that MakerDAO is not only maintaining its existing user base but also attracting new participants.

Beyond user engagement, developer activity serves as a strong indicator of long-term viability. MakerDAO’s **GitHub repository** continues to show **strong development activity, with over ten active developers making regular contributions each month**. This level of ongoing development suggests that the protocol remains under continuous refinement, ensuring adaptability in the ever-evolving DeFi landscape.

Despite the rise of alternative CDP platforms, MakerDAO remains the industry leader due to its **deep liquidity, robust risk management mechanisms, and a well-maintained governance structure**. The protocol’s **strong TVL, active user engagement, and continuous developer activity** highlight its resilience and ongoing relevance in DeFi. The upcoming **MakerDAO 2.0 (Sky)** rebrand introduces further strategic changes that could solidify its dominance, although the broader evolution of blockchain and DeFi will ultimately determine its trajectory.
